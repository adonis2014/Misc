Frontends:  receive and route request
Datanodes:  store the actual data. Each datanode manages a number of disks
Cluster Managers: maintain the states of cluster including partition state, partition location, disk placement etc.

Datacenter = Frontends + Datanodes + Cluster Managers (Zookeeper to coordinate)
