Frontends:  receive and route request
Datanodes:  store the actual data. Each datanode manages a number of disks
Cluster Managers: maintain the states of cluster including partition state, partition location, disk placement etc.

Datacenter = Frontends + Datanodes + Cluster Managers (Zookeeper to coordinate)

blob: large immutable data / large media objects

proxy request: forward requests to other data centers when data is not replicated in current datacenter.

partition: a logical group of blobs, current size is 100GB (at first ready-write then it becomes read-only)

CDN = Content Delivery Network

Router Library:  choose a partition, communicate with Datanode in charge and serve the request.
