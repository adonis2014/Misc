1. Gradle concepts:
   (1) Project: A project is either something we build (e.g. a jar file) or do (deploy our application to production environment). 
                A project consists of one or more tasks.
   (2) Task: A task is an atomic unit work which is performed our build (e.g. compiling our project or running tests).
   
   (3) Build: every Gradle build contains one or more projects.
   
2. Gradle config files:
   (1) build.gradle:       specifies a project and its tasks
   (2) gradle.properties:  is used to configure the properties of the build
   (3) settings.gradle:    for only one project, it's optional. For multiple projects, it is mandatory 
                           because it describes which projects participate to our build. 
                           Every multi-project build must have a settings file in the root project of the project hierarchy.
                           
3. Gradle plugin:
   All useful features are provided by Gradle plugins. A Gradle plugin can:
   (1) Add new tasks to the project.
   (2) Provide a default configuration for the added tasks.
   (3) Add new properties which are used to override the default configuration.
   (4) Add new dependencies to the project.
   
   Types of plugin: <1> script plugins;  <2> binary plugins
   
   apply a Gradle plugin = add a plugin to a project  (by using either its name or type)
   e.g. adding plugin to build.gradle:
       apply plugin: 'com.bar.foo'


4. Create a Java project:
